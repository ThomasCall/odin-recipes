    <p>An elevated version of homestyle pot roast, this braised beef is hearty and full of earthy richness. It would pair well with mashed potatoes, buttery noodles, or crusty bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ pounds boneless beef chuck roast</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

        </li>
        <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
        <li>Season beef pieces evenly on all sides with 3 1/2 teaspoons salt, 2 teaspoons pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add beef, reduce heat to medium high and cook, undisturbed until it releases easily from the skillet and a golden brown crust has formed, about 4 minutes. Flip pieces and continue to cook until browned on all sides. Remove meat from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Return skillet to medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons butter to the drippings in the pan. When butter has melted add onion, mushrooms and carrots and cook 5 minutes, stirring often, scraping to release any browned bits from the bottom. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in wine and scrape to release any more bits from the pan. Return the meat to the pan, along with any accumulated juices and add thyme, bay leaves and Worcestershire.</li>
    </ol>
